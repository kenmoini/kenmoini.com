> Azure is...

![The worst](/images/posts/2022/02/the_worst.gif)

Ok, credit where credit is due, Azure isn't a bad cloud provider, it's just confusing as all get out to me - for better or worst, my wheelhouse is with AWS.  Those certifications probably have something to do with it...I should really look into re-upping my AWS certs and check out the Azure and GCP certs this year...

Getting back to Azure though, recently I participated in a pooled effort to deploy [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/openshift/) in a particularly bespoke environment.  There were some initial difficulties which led me to create an Azure account and work on deploying it myself to do some troubleshooting.
